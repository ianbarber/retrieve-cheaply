*Making a Language Server Pay Off for a Coding Agent: Redundant Information, Cheaper Retrieval*.

We ask two questions about giving a coding agent a language server: does it help by supplying
**information**, and does it help by making retrieval **cheaper**. The answer to the first is no
(a model that can read files derives the same types and references itself). The answer to the
second is yes, but only under three conditions, and getting the agent to use the cheap action is
free for capable models and trainable for weak ones.

## The result

1. **Information is redundant.** Across correction, completeness, navigation, prevention, scale,
   and type inference, handing a self-retrieving agent the language server's information does not
   raise pass@1. At the frontier a `check_types()` tool is solved 32/32 with and without it, and
   `claude-sonnet-4.5` never calls it.

2. **Efficiency is real, under three conditions.** A `<defn>` action cuts input tokens 3.5 to 4.7
   times at equal success, when retrieval is required, the counterfactual is a whole-file read, and
   the agent chooses the cheap action. The tool-value ablation toggles the action on the same model:

   | model | tokens with `<defn>` | tokens read-only | factor |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | 27B (real obscure suite) | 1302 | 4563 | 3.5× |
   | claude-sonnet-4.5 (tool-calling) | 6018 | 21985 | 3.7× |
   | deepseek-chat-v3.1 (tool-calling) | 7705 | 36192 | 4.7× |

3. **Election is capability-gated.** A 7B uses `<defn>` 2% by default and ignores a prompt telling
   it to prefer the action; one on-policy training round takes it to 100% use and 4.5 times fewer
   tokens. A capable model needs no training: framing `<defn>` in the system prompt as cheaper than
   a read moves an untrained 27B to 88 to 93% use and a frontier model to 100%.

## The recipe

1. Expose go-to-definition as an action, not diagnostics as context. The information in
   diagnostics, references, and completion is redundant for a self-retrieving agent.
2. Frame it in the system prompt as cheaper than a read. Capable models then use it without training.
3. If the model is weak enough to ignore the framing, train the preference on-policy: roll out the
   agent, rewrite its `<read>` of a resolvable symbol to `<defn sym>`, and fine-tune on the relabeled
   trajectories (one DAgger round).
4. Mix in tasks that genuinely need a full read, so the agent learns when the cheap action suffices.

## Reproduce

```bash
pip install -e .                       # add '.[api]' for the frontier tool-calling path
python scripts/analysis/stats.py       # recompute the 7B training numbers from committed JSONs
```

`stats.py` recomputes every weak-model training number from the committed `runs/agent/*.json` and
checks each against `PAPER.md` (`[MATCH]` lines). `effic_real_stats.py` does the paired stats for the
real-code and tool-ablation runs. The `scripts/run_*.sh` drivers regenerate the JSONs:

| Driver | Reproduces |
|---|---|
| `run_relabel2.sh` | 7B on-policy training (harvest, SFT, retest), PAPER §5 |
| `run_toolablation.sh` | tool-value ablation, with `<defn>` vs read-only, PAPER §4 |
| `run_frontier.sh` | frontier election and efficiency via OpenRouter, PAPER §4 to §5 |
| `run_gapd_frontier.sh` | the type-inference information channel, PAPER §3 |
| `run_relabel2_27b.sh` | 27B cross-scale transfer, Appendix B |
| `run_grpo.sh` | cost-reward RL corroboration, Appendix A |

## Test a different model or approach

`scripts/api_agent.py` is a model-agnostic tool-calling harness. Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (or place
the key in a `.orkey` file at the repo root, gitignored) and point it at any OpenRouter model to
measure election and the tool-value ablation, with a hard spend cap:

```bash
# election and efficiency on the obscure real-code suite:
python scripts/api_agent.py out.json --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5 \
    --suite effic_real2 --seeds 2 --budget-usd 5
# the read-only counterfactual (same, with <defn> removed):
python scripts/api_agent.py out_ro.json --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5 \
    --suite effic_real2 --no-defn --seeds 2 --budget-usd 12
# the information channel (a check_types() tool available vs not):
python scripts/api_agent.py out_gd.json --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5 \
    --suite gapd --with-check --seeds 2 --budget-usd 6
```

The local harness (`scripts/synth_mf.py`) does the same for open-weight models, with `--no-defn`
(tool ablation) and `--adapter` (a trained policy).

## Code layout

|---|---|
| `scaffold/stream_agent.py` | local token-stream coding agent (`<read>`/`<defn>`/`<findrefs>`/`<test>`/`<edit>`, `--no-defn` ablation) |
| `scaffold/mock_env.py` | in-memory workspace with real Pyrefly and the `<defn>` resolver |
| `scaffold/real_env.py` | `RealRepoEnv` over a checked-out git repo, with qualified `module.Class.method` resolution |
| `scripts/api_agent.py` | OpenRouter tool-calling harness (test any frontier model) |
| `scripts/synth_tasks_effic.py` | synthetic definition-sufficient efficiency suite |
| `scripts/synth_tasks_efficread.py` | read-required boundary suite |
| `scripts/synth_tasks_effic_real{,2}.py` | real vendored-library suites (`effic_real_vendor/`) |
| `scripts/synth_tasks_gapd.py` | type-inference (information-channel) suite |
| `scripts/synth_mf.py`, `scripts/real_mf.py` | local condition runners |

| `scripts/grpo_cost.py` | cost-reward GRPO corroboration (optional) |

## Layout and environment

`runs/agent/` holds the committed result JSONs; `runs/sft/` holds trained LoRA adapters (gitignored
binaries); `log.md` is the full chronological lab log; `docs/` has figures and the bibliography.
Pyrefly is the static analyzer, default path `.venv-streams/bin/pyrefly`, overridable with
`STREAMS_PYREFLY`. Hardware for the local runs: a single NVIDIA DGX Spark (GB10, 128 GB unified
memory).
