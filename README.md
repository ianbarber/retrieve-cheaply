# When Do Language Servers Help Coding Agents?

This repository studies a conditional engineering question rather than defending a universal LSP claim:

> When do semantic retrieval, readable/inferred types, checker feedback, and server-backed operations
> improve a coding agent after election, actionability, latency, and context costs are counted?

The working model is:

`opportunity × correctness/uniqueness × compression × election × actionability − cost`.

LSP is the transport; a language server is the semantic implementation; types are semantic substrate; a
type checker produces consistency diagnostics; and pull tools, pushed context, patch-boundary feedback,
gates, rerankers, constrained decoding, and training rewards are distinct integrations.

## Current findings

**Supported, narrow positive.** A compact definition result cuts pooled input tokens 3.5–4.7x at unchanged
success when the counterfactual is a whole-file library read. After averaging rollout seeds within task,
the treatment is cheaper on 11/11 local-27B tasks, 11/11 Sonnet tasks, and 10/11 DeepSeek tasks. Mean
per-task ratios are 4.02, 3.65, and 6.03; medians are 3.83, 3.01, and 2.70. Most of these runs use a static
AST resolver, so this supports compact retrieval, not LSP transport in general.

**Supported policy result.** Tool election is model- and policy-dependent. Prompting works in some
capable-model runs; on-policy relabeling and cost-reward training change a 7B model’s retrieval choice.
This is not evidence for a monotonic parameter-count law.

**Tentative negative regimes.** A historical dispatch suite shows near-one token ratios when a capable
agent can read the concrete receiver and open the target directly. The suite leaks that information and
has no erased-type arm, so it does not prove semantic navigation is redundant. Historical checker arms
compare unrelated first drafts, and their residual counts were contaminated by an in-workspace test file.
Corrected replay nevertheless finds checker-positive diagnostics in both coherent recoverable historical
workspaces. Execution/checker inference suites are at behavioral ceiling, but checker opportunity was not
measured there; neither fact establishes equivalence.

**New apparatus evidence.** The repaired `navigation-v2` typed/erased apparatus uses sound per-key `Literal`
overloads in `.pyi` files over byte-identical runtime code. It passes base/gold, held-out, all-key runtime
contract, type-cleanliness, leakage, widened-call, and strict live-Pyrefly checks on all four pilot instances and twelve additional
apparatus-audit instances. Those 12 are not confirmation because validator changes followed their first
inspection; a new disjoint 12-instance confirmation split passes mechanical checks and is reserved behind
source hashes without model exposure. The earlier 7B `navigation-v1` pilot used an unsound gold-derived
factory return and is retained only as invalid apparatus history. In v2, 7B fails the buggy-span control
0/2 and a pinned 14B rung reaches 1/2, so neither runs a matrix. After a tested compact-edit parser fix,
pinned Qwen3.6-27B clears both controls 2/2 and runs the sound matrix. All 12 cells pass, making correctness
non-identifying; typed automatic context falls within the token-ratio margin on these two pilot tasks only,
erased automatic context adds cost, and every automatic result is followed by a target read. Automatic
resolution also adds about six seconds of composed harness lookup time per task. This is a
precision/overhead boundary, not the missing useful-compression result, so confirmation remains blocked.
Fresh checker calibration stops correctly: 7B produces 0/3 coherent drafts, while 14B produces 2/8 and
both are type-clean. Neither reaches the 20–70% opportunity band.
A pre-treatment selection artifact therefore freezes the two exact recovered coherent checker-positive
workspaces for a conditional case series. Pinned Qwen3.6-27B completes paired control, patch-boundary, and
gate revisions. The first replay is rejected as outcome evidence: ambiguous same-line edit serialization
introduces syntax errors on the harder task, creating the apparent terminal-cleanliness difference. Every
arm remains 1/2 on joint accepted-clean-correct. The unresolved gate trajectory never invokes the gate, so
the run supplies no gate-prevention evidence.
A protocol-v2 rerun removes that artifact and records completion/gate events separately. One-shot
diagnostics finish type-clean on 2/2 selected workspaces versus 1/2 control, but every arm remains 1/2 on
held pass and accepted-clean-correct; diagnostics add 217 mean revision tokens. The unresolved control and
gate trajectories diverge before either attempts completion, so the gate arm is excluded from causal
contrasts. Protocol v3 repairs this pairing check and publishes only after validation; it has not been run.
This is intermediate checker-state evidence, not a correctness, prevalence, or prevention result.

## Fast reproduction

Python 3.10+ is required. Install the analysis/LSP development dependencies, then run the no-model
reproducer:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e '.[dev,analysis]'
python3 scripts/analysis/reproduce_all.py
```

The command verifies `evidence/manifest.json`, reruns every analyzer retained in the report, recomputes
task-level effects, and reruns all navigation mechanical gates. It makes no model or API calls.
Pyrefly is discovered from `STREAMS_PYREFLY`, `PYREFLY_BIN`, PATH, `.venv/bin`, or
`.venv-streams/bin`.

Targeted commands:

```bash
python3 scripts/analysis/stats.py
python3 scripts/analysis/effic_real_stats.py \
  --base runs/agent/er2_27b_readonly.json \
  --trained runs/agent/er2_27b_base.json --label 27B
python3 scripts/analysis/task_level_effects.py \
  --base runs/agent/er2_27b_readonly.json \
  --treatment runs/agent/er2_27b_base.json --label 27B
python3 scripts/experiments/navigation_tasks.py --split pilot
```

## Expensive runs

No paid API run is authorized. Local pilots have a monetary cap of `$0`. Navigation model artifacts use
an explicit run tag and refuse overwrites, preserving every model rung and the invalidated v1 evidence.
The calibration driver exactly regenerates the three reported 1,400-token batches; the separate case-series
driver runs the preselected checker-positive cohort:

```bash
RUN_ID=qwen25coder14b-pilot001 \
  MODEL=Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Instruct \
  REVISION=aedcc2d42b622764e023cf882b6652e646b95671 \
  PYTHON=python3 scripts/run_navigation_pilot.sh
PYTHON=python3 scripts/run_checker_paired.sh
PYTHON=python3 scripts/run_checker_case_series.sh
```

The case-series driver now targets a new protocol-v3 output. It records full no-completion trajectory hashes,
requires pre-gate control/gate identity, and atomically publishes only a validated result; it does not
overwrite the preserved v2 artifact.

The confirmation command is intentionally separate and runs only after the v2 gold-copy and buggy-span
controls and pilot clear the preregistered gates. Against the completed 27B pilot below, it exits before
model loading because the shared parser changed after the run; the at-run pilot is also uniformly at ceiling
and therefore scientifically ineligible for confirmation:

```bash
PILOT_RUN_ID=qwen36-27b-6a9e13bd-pilot002 RUN_ID=qwen36-27b-confirm001 \
  MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B \
  REVISION=6a9e13bd6fc8f0983b9b99948120bc37f49c13e9 \
  PYTHON=python3 scripts/run_navigation_confirmation.sh
```

Historical OpenRouter drivers still require `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `.orkey` and enforce their own
`--budget-usd` limits. Do not run them merely to reproduce the report; committed JSON is sufficient.

## Decision recipe

1. Use text search and ranged reads for unique, local bindings.
2. Use typed semantic resolution for genuinely non-lexical ambiguity.
3. Keep semantic retrieval only when it replaces substantial reading or prevents wrong-file work.
4. Run target-scoped diagnostic deltas on coherent agent patches; checker cleanliness is not correctness.
5. Gate only when telemetry shows prevention of defects the ungated agent would actually submit.

Compact retrieval has narrow repository support; useful semantic-navigation value remains open. The repaired
checker replay shows a selected terminal-state effect without correctness gain; its gate pairing is invalid
and gate prevention remains open.
The confidence-labeled decision table and claim links are in
[REPORT.md](REPORT.md#6-practitioner-decision-table).

Always measure whether semantic retrieval substitutes for a read, the checker opportunity rate, whether
the model edits diagnosed locations, and accepted-defect rate. Static tooling will not solve dynamic
behavior, logical errors outside the type system, incorrect annotations, `Any` boundaries, or failures the
model cannot act on.

## Repository layout

| `scaffold/` | agent and workspace environments |
| `docs/real_repo_progress.md` | preserved chronological research log; not the final claim source |

Historical evidence is preserved. Where raw data or exact provenance is missing, the claim ledger marks
the result tentative or unsupported instead of reconstructing certainty from `log.md` summaries.
