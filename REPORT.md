# When Do Language Servers Help Coding Agents?

## Abstract

Language servers can help coding agents by resolving bindings that text cannot distinguish, returning compact code context, and checking patches. The experiments show a narrow but clear effect: compact definition retrieval cut input tokens by 3.5–4.7x at unchanged success when it replaced whole-file reads, and a live-first Pyrefly/AST hybrid showed the same direction. Semantic navigation was near token-neutral when text already exposed the target. In sound typed/erased tasks, type information let Pyrefly distinguish the correct implementation from many same-named alternatives, but the two-task agent pilot reread every target file and gained neither correctness nor lower cost. On two selected workspaces with checker-detectable errors, one-shot diagnostics produced one additional type-clean result at 217 extra revision tokens without improving held-out correctness. The gate comparison logged zero rejections, so prevention is unevaluated.

For practitioners, start with the cheapest workflow that resolves the task. Add typed semantic resolution when it prevents wrong-target work, compact semantic spans when they replace broad retrieval, and diagnostics when coherent patches contain actionable static errors. Measure changed actions and outcomes rather than tool calls. Improve election only after demonstrating service value, and deploy gates only when measurements show that bad submissions are actually rejected.

## Evidence limits at a glance

- **Compact retrieval:** supported against whole-file reads on constructed tasks; advantage over efficient grep plus ranged reads is unmeasured.
- **Typed navigation:** mechanism supported (sound types sharpen resolution); agent-level benefit not shown — only two pilot tasks, every automatic result followed by a target read.
- **Checker feedback:** descriptive intermediate-state effect on two selected recovered workspaces; no held-out correctness gain.
- **Gates:** unevaluated — no rejection event was observed.
- **Real-repository generalization:** unresolved — the bounded scan found no fully admissible task.

## Decision checklist

Before adding a language-server integration, check:

1. **Is there a concrete bottleneck the server removes?** Ambiguous binding, broad retrieval, or repairable static error.
2. **Does the integration change what the agent does?** Fewer reads, correct target, or repaired defect.
3. **Is the outcome better or cheaper?** Held-out tests pass, total tokens fall, or wall time drops.
4. **Have you measured the failure mode?** Gates need rejection events; diagnostics need coherent drafts.

## Practitioner guide

| When you see… | Then default to… | Evidence in this report | Verify by measuring… | Do not use when… |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| The binding is local, visible, and unique | Text search plus ranged reads | Navigation is near token-neutral when prompts expose the receiver and target ([C6](evidence/claim_ledger.md#c6), [C9](evidence/claim_ledger.md#c9)) | Wrong-file edits, target reads avoided, total tokens | The prompt already names the target file and line |
| Overloads, inheritance, factories, or re-exports make the target ambiguous | Typed semantic resolution | Sound types improve resolver precision; agent-level benefit remains open ([C15](evidence/claim_ledger.md#c15), [C24](evidence/claim_ledger.md#c24)) | Wrong-target work prevented, retrieval reduced, not just tool calls | Text already identifies the exact target |
| A compact result can replace broad reading | Definition or enclosing-method span | 3.5–4.7x fewer input tokens vs. whole-file reads; the live-first result uses a composed Pyrefly/AST integration ([C1](evidence/claim_ledger.md#c1), [C4](evidence/claim_ledger.md#c4)) | Confirm the agent does not reread the full file | The agent still reads the whole file after receiving the span |
| A coherent patch contains checker-detectable errors | Show new relevant checker errors after the patch | One extra type-clean result in two selected cases; no correctness gain ([C26](evidence/claim_ledger.md#c26)) | Held-out tests pass and total cost including diagnostics | The draft is incoherent or the error is not repairable |
| A useful service is available but rarely chosen | Improve tool description or policy | Prompting and training change election in model-specific runs ([C2](evidence/claim_ledger.md#c2), [C3](evidence/claim_ledger.md#c3)) | Higher election retains correctness and lowers total cost | The service has not first shown value when available |
| Bad submission prevention | **Unevaluated** — gates need a rejection event before deployment | No valid gate contrast; zero rejections observed ([C14](evidence/claim_ledger.md#c14), [C26](evidence/claim_ledger.md#c26)) | Controlled experiment in which the gate rejects bad submissions that would otherwise be accepted | You have not observed the gate block a real bad submission |

## 1. How language-server assistance creates value

Language-server assistance addresses three distinct bottlenecks:

- **Resolve:** identify the correct program entity when names or local text are ambiguous. Type information, whether written or inferred, can distinguish overloads, implementations, and factory results.
- **Compress:** return the needed definition, signature, or method span instead of making the agent search and read broader source context.
- **Validate:** expose a checker-detectable defect in a coherent patch while the agent can still repair it, or prevent a bad patch from being accepted.

Agents can request these services, receive results automatically, or use them through patch feedback, acceptance gates, candidate reranking, structured operations, and training rewards. Delivery changes availability and election; it cannot make redundant information useful.

The common value chain is:

`real opportunity -> useful semantic signal -> changed agent action -> lower cost or higher correctness`

Each step must be measured. Correct resolution is not an agent benefit if the same target was already clear. Compact context saves nothing if the agent rereads the file. A diagnostic has no outcome value on a clean draft or when the model cannot repair the reported error.

## 2. Results

The [claim ledger](evidence/claim_ledger.md) maps every material claim to its artifacts and status. The [manifest](evidence/manifest.json) records hashes, configurations, and provenance warnings.

### Recipe 1: Use compact spans when they replace whole-file reads

The `effic` and `effic_real2` tasks ask an agent to implement a small target with an unfamiliar library API. The treatment returns a compact definition; the counterfactual drives whole-file retrieval. Every attempt in both arms succeeds.

| Model | Pooled input-token ratio | Tasks cheaper with definition | Mean task ratio (95% bootstrap CI) | Success |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Qwen3.6-27B | 3.50x | 11/11 | 4.02 (2.85–5.30) | 44/44 both arms |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | 3.65x | 11/11 | 3.65 (2.72–5.20) | 44/44 both arms |
| DeepSeek v3.1 | 4.70x | 10/11 | 6.03 (2.32–10.82) | 44/44 both arms |

The task-level medians are 3.83, 3.01, and 2.70; DeepSeek's distribution is strongly skewed. Seeds are repeated runs within tasks, and intervals resample task means. The three-model comparison uses the repository's static AST resolver and measures compact retrieval against whole-file reading ([C1](evidence/claim_ledger.md#c1)).

Tool election is a policy question. In matched local 7B runs, definition-trained and read-trained policies both solve 40 cells while mean input falls from 3,191 to 684 tokens. Relabeling raises definition use from approximately zero to 100%; cost-reward training reaches 86% use with 36/36 success. Prompting and training can change election, but these runs do not establish a model-size law ([C2](evidence/claim_ledger.md#c2), [C3](evidence/claim_ledger.md#c3)).

A live-first Pyrefly suite reduces mean input from 2,894 to 689 tokens and raises success from 14/24 to 24/24. The tool combines live lookup with AST-selected use sites, span expansion, and fallback, and the rows do not record which backend answered. The estimate therefore applies to the composed integration ([C4](evidence/claim_ledger.md#c4)).

**Takeaway:** compact definitions reduce cost when they replace coarse retrieval. Their advantage over efficient grep plus ranged reads remains unmeasured here.

### Recipe 2: Use typed semantic resolution when it prevents wrong-target work

A 15-task dispatch suite compares grep/ranged reads with live Pyrefly goto. On the annotated 27B variant, grep, neutral goto, and framed goto solve 15/15, 14/15, and 15/15; matched-success token ratios are 0.972 and 1.041. Stripped and factory-indirection variants remain near one (0.945–1.065).

The prompts expose the concrete receiver and make the correct file cheap to identify, so this suite measures a redundant-navigation regime. It has no erased or `Any` condition, and some variants still describe an annotation that has been removed. Goto adds little when text already reveals the answer ([C6](evidence/claim_ledger.md#c6), [C9](evidence/claim_ledger.md#c9)).

The typed/erased navigation pilot isolates this mechanism. Typed and erased repositories have byte-identical runtime code, tests, and gold patches. Only `factory.pyi` differs: the typed stub has sound per-key `Literal` overloads; the erased stub returns the base type. Each task contains 8–15 same-named overrides, and neither the prompt nor failure names the target class or path. Strict live Pyrefly resolves the definition at the use site without AST fallback. Mechanical checks confirm that typed lookup reaches the gold override, erased lookup returns a non-discriminating base result, widening the key removes the discrimination, and both variants are type-clean ([C15](evidence/claim_ledger.md#c15)).

The 7B and 14B models fail a supplied-span edit control. Qwen3.6-27B passes it, so the two-task comparison uses that model:

| Outcome | Result |
|---|---:|
| Correctness | All 12 task-condition runs pass |
| Typed automatic / typed textual tokens | 1.037 (task bootstrap 0.988–1.093) |
| Erased automatic / erased textual tokens | 1.190 (1.119–1.251) |
| Typed-by-automatic interaction | -214 tokens (-402 to -26) |
| Automatic-result substitution | Every result is followed by a target-file read |
| Neutral / framed elective use | 0/2 and 1/2 |

The typed ratio lies inside the prespecified 0.90–1.10 margin for these two pilot tasks; two tasks are insufficient for population equivalence. Lookup itself takes about six seconds per task, dominated by a fixed indexing wait. Including that lookup, descriptive end-to-end times are about 109 seconds for automatic context and 64 seconds for textual baselines. Correctness is ceilinged, and the tool does not replace retrieval ([C24](evidence/claim_ledger.md#c24)).

**Takeaway:** sound types improve resolver precision. Agent value requires that precision to change localization, prevent wrong-target work, or reduce retrieval; automatic delivery alone can turn a correct answer into extra context and latency.

### Recipe 3: Use checker feedback only on coherent, repairable errors

The broad checker suites do not isolate feedback value. Frontier inference arms and 27B authoring arms are at ceiling (18/18 and 12/12), while the 7B authoring arms use different first drafts. Exact recovery finds two coherent workspaces with relevant semantic diagnostics, but natural-draft calibration produces no usable opportunity: 0/3 7B drafts are coherent, and the 2/8 coherent 14B drafts are already type-clean ([C11](evidence/claim_ledger.md#c11), [C16](evidence/claim_ledger.md#c16), [C22](evidence/claim_ledger.md#c22)).

A paired case series forks each of the two recovered workspaces into control and one-shot diagnostic revisions:

| Outcome | Control | One-shot diagnostics |
|---|---:|---:|
| Type-clean final workspace | 1/2 | 2/2 |
| Held-out tests pass | 1/2 | 1/2 |
| Accepted, type-clean, and held-out-correct | 1/2 | 1/2 |
| Mean revision tokens | 1,368 | 1,585 |

Diagnostics improve an intermediate checker state on one selected task, at 217 extra revision tokens, but do not improve behavioral or joint success. The sample contains two selected workspaces and one seed; draft-generation cost is unavailable ([C26](evidence/claim_ledger.md#c26)).

The paired gate arm diverges from control before either attempts completion and records no rejection event, so prevention is unmeasured.

**Takeaway:** diagnostics can improve checker state without improving behavior. Their value depends on coherent patches with actionable diagnostics, successful repair, and a better accepted outcome at acceptable cost.

### Execution feedback and external validity

Execution feedback is ceilinged in the committed small-task suite: two frontier models, 14 tasks, three seeds, and three delivery modes all pass, for 252/252 attempts. This does not establish equivalence outside small simulable functions.

The bounded real-repository scan found no fully admissible task. One Django case has a working environment and substantial override ambiguity, but leakage and fix-site resolution were not fully audited. Both recorded arms pass and the semantic tool is not elected. Constructed tasks therefore provide the cleanest causal apparatus here, while population validity remains open. The audit and rejection reasons are in [docs/external_validity_recon.md](docs/external_validity_recon.md).

Across this report and prior work, static tooling helps when it supplies missing, correct, compact, actionable information at the phase where the model can use it. The common failure modes are duplicate information, no checker opportunity, ignored or noisy delivery, and cost that exceeds the work saved.

## 4. Reproducibility and limits

From a clean clone:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e '.[dev,analysis]'
python3 scripts/analysis/reproduce_all.py
```

The reproducer verifies the manifest, reruns retained analyzers, recomputes task-level effects, and executes the navigation manipulation checks without making model or API calls. Model runs are separate; see [evidence/protocols.md](evidence/protocols.md) before using the navigation or checker run scripts.

The main limits are:

- Static tooling does not address dynamic behavior, incorrect annotations, `Any`-heavy boundaries, environment failures, or logic outside the checker.
- Compact-retrieval tasks are synthetic and compare against whole-file reads; efficient ranged retrieval is the harder baseline.
- The typed navigation outcome comes from two pilot tasks with ceilinged correctness; there is no outcome headroom or retrieval substitution to justify confirmation.
- The checker result comes from two selected recovered workspaces. It does not estimate natural opportunity prevalence or full end-to-end cost, and the gate comparison logged no rejections.
- The real-repository scan found no fully admissible case, so external validity is unresolved.
- Some retained artifacts contain provenance gaps, including unavailable seed shards, incomplete server backend/version records, source-hash mismatches, and invalidated runs. Exclusion reasons and discrepancies are reported in the claim ledger and manifest.

Within these limits, the evidence supports compact retrieval against whole-file reads and the mechanistic claim that sound types sharpen semantic resolution.

## Conclusion

Language-server services can create value by resolving ambiguity, compressing retrieval, or validating a patch. The experiments demonstrate compact retrieval against broad reads and type-driven gains in resolver precision. They do not yet demonstrate a general navigation benefit, a checker-driven correctness gain, or gate prevention.

The deployment standard is the same for each service: identify a real opportunity, verify that the semantic signal changes the agent's action, and measure whether that change lowers cost or improves correctness. Availability and invocation are not outcomes. The useful integration is the smallest targeted operation that removes work or prevents an error the agent would otherwise carry forward.
