"""Continuous-stream coding agent (efficiency-recipe edition).

The agent generates one token stream of reasoning and edits under condition A
(no inline diagnostic feedback). The final recipe trains it to prefer the cheap
`<defn>` / `<findrefs>` go-to-definition actions over expensive whole-file
`<read>`.

Supported edit formats (parsed live):
  SEARCH/REPLACE/END block
  <edit path="FILE" lines="START-END"> block

Supported retrieval/test actions:
  <read path="FILE"/>
  <defn sym="NAME"/>
  <findrefs sym="NAME"/>
  <test/>
  <done/>

The agent is environment-agnostic and expects the env to provide:
  read_file(path) -> str
  apply_edit(path, search, replace) -> (ok: bool, info: str)
  apply_line_edit(path, start, end, new_text) -> (ok: bool, info: str)
  goto_definition(sym) -> (src: str|None, path: str|None)
  find_references(sym) -> list[str]|None
  lsp_definition(sym) -> (src: str|None, path: str|None)   [optional, for --lsp-defn]
  run_tests() -> dict
  metrics() -> dict
