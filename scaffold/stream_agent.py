"""Continuous-stream coding agent with live (in-flight) LSP feedback — the v0.5
option-D apparatus. The agent generates ONE continuous token stream of reasoning
+ edits; depending on the condition, pyrefly diagnostics about completed edits are
delivered:
  A : never (no feedback)
  C : synchronously — generation PAUSES at the edit boundary, the diagnostic is
      injected, then generation resumes (production post-edit-hook / turn feedback)
  D : live/async — generation does NOT pause; the diagnostic is spliced into the
      stream `latency_tokens` AFTER the edit completes (the model sees it
      mid-work and must look back), exactly the prototype-validated KV splice.

Edit format the model emits (parsed live from the stream):
    <edit path="FILE">
    <<<<<<< SEARCH
    ...old...
    =======
    ...new...
    >>>>>>> REPLACE
    </edit>
and a final  <done/>  to stop.

The agent is environment-agnostic: it calls an env with
  read_file(path) -> str
  apply_edit(path, search, replace) -> (ok: bool, info: str)   # records rework
  pyrefly_diagnostics(path) -> str   # normalized "(sev,line,code,msg)" text, or ""
  run_tests() -> dict  (resolved: bool, ...)
  metrics() -> dict
