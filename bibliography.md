## Core substrate

### Su, Yang, Li, Geiping, *Multi-Stream LLMs* (2026)
Architectural substrate. Stream-aware RoPE, learnable stream embeddings, cross-stream causal mask, interleaved packing for FlashAttention compatibility. Releases two checkpoints: `stream-qwen3-8b` (dense Qwen3-8B backbone, ~16.4 GB BF16) and `stream-qwen3.5-27b` (DeltaNet-hybrid backbone, ~53.8 GB BF16). Smaller variants discussed in `sec5_efficiency/` are training pipelines, not released weights. 10 fixed channels named for cognitive functions (User, Output, Analytical, Skeptical, Intuitive, Between, Curious, Void, Instinct, Synthesis). Inference API: `stream_generate_iter` returns a generator supporting `gen.send(tok)` for environment-driven input; `model.generate()` is intentionally disabled. Lists tool feedback as motivating but does not implement asynchronous tool streams. **[Foundational — D's architecture builds on this directly. v1 substrate is `stream-qwen3-8b`; 27B reserved for v2 follow-up due to dense vs DeltaNet-hybrid architecture difference.]**

## Adjacent prior work (asynchronous / streaming tool use)

### Ginart et al., *Asynchronous Tool Usage for Real-Time Agents* (Salesforce, 2024)
Event-driven FSM architecture wrapping a single-stream LLM; agent loop decomposed into states whose transitions are driven by external events (speech, tool returns, timeouts) rather than end-of-turn token. Integrated with ASR/TTS for concurrent voice interaction. **System demonstration, not a learned policy.** Distinguishing dimensions vs ours: (a) runtime FSM, not architectural multi-stream; (b) voice dialogue domain; (c) demonstrative rather than controlled comparison; (d) open-ended tool surface.

```

### Hooper et al., *Speculative Interaction Agents* (UC Berkeley, May 2026)
**Closest prior work in spirit.** Asynchronous I/O + speculative tool calling for real-time agents. Introduces *clock-based training*: timestamps interleaved into the token stream so the model learns time-aware behaviour, with a synthetic SFT corpus pairing streaming inputs with async tool returns. Reports **1.3–2.2× wall-clock speedup** on HotpotQA / conversational tasks with minor accuracy degradation. Distinguishing dimensions vs ours: (a) single-stream transformer with inline clock tokens, not separate streams; (b) latency target, not capability; (c) generic tools vs LSP; (d) open-domain Q&A, not SWE. Their synthetic-trace construction is a direct reference for our §7.3 corpus.

### Gong et al., *GhostShell* (Aug 2025)
Streaming LLM function calls for concurrent embodied programming. Three components: streaming XML function-token parser; dynamic function-interface mapper; **multi-channel scheduler** coordinating *intra-channel synchronous* and *inter-channel asynchronous* calls. Evaluated on robot prototype "COCO," 34 real-world interaction tasks, behavioural-correctness 0.85 (Claude-4-Sonnet), up to **66× faster** than native LLM function-calling. Distinguishing dimensions vs ours: (a) external scheduler, no architectural change to LLM; (b) embodied robotics; (c) system demonstration; (d) **outgoing** robot commands on parallel channels — direction of asynchrony is reversed from ours (we stream incoming diagnostics).

## Methodology / evaluation

### Bjarnason, Silva & Monperrus, *On Randomness in Agentic Evals* (Feb 2026)
**Methodological backbone for our power analysis.** ~60 000 agent trajectories across three models × two scaffolds on SWE-bench Verified. Headline findings: single-run pass@1 estimates **vary by 2.2–6.0 pp**; standard deviations **exceed 1.5 pp even at T=0**; trajectories diverge within the first few percent of tokens. Many claimed 2–3 pp improvements in the SWE-bench literature are statistically indistinguishable from noise. Recommends (1) multiple runs per task, (2) explicit power analysis, (3) reporting pass@k *and* pass^k (probability every of k attempts passes) as a consistency metric.
