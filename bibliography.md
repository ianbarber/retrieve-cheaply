## Substrate and tooling

### Su, Yang, Li & Geiping, *Multi-Stream LLMs* (2026)
Architectural substrate for the stream harness. Releases `stream-qwen3-8b` and
`stream-qwen3.5-27b` checkpoints. The harness in `scaffold/stream_agent.py` builds on this,
but the report's contribution is retrieval efficiency, not the stream architecture.

## Closest prior work: language servers as RL signal

### Zhang et al., *RLCSF* (2025)
Reinforcement Learning from Compiler and Language Server Feedback. Rewards LSP/compiler
diagnostics during RL. The closest prior work: RLCSF treats LSP feedback as a useful signal;
we find its information redundant on our suites and focus on its retrieval efficiency.
