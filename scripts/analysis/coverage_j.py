"""Coverage-judging score J for the `cover` suite (does the agent read based on what
`<defn>` returned, or on task shape?).

For a result JSON produced by `synth_mf.py --suite cover`, each task is one of three
byte-identical-surface variants of a topic:
  cover_<topic>_suf    coverage SUFFICIENT (defn returns the value)        -> should NOT read
  cover_<topic>_f1ins  INSUFFICIENT, mechanism F1 (forwarding alias)       -> must read
  cover_<topic>_f2ins  INSUFFICIENT, mechanism F2 (value externalised)     -> must read

The coverage-judging score:
    J = P(read | insufficient) - P(read | sufficient)
A model that JUDGES coverage has J >> 0 (reads exactly when the defn it saw was inadequate).
A SHAPE-KEYED model has J ~ 0 on a held-out mechanism, because its read-decision does not
depend on the content `<defn>` returned. We report J separately by mechanism:
  J_F1 = read(f1ins) - read(suf)   (F1 = training mechanism, if F1 was trained on)
  J_F2 = read(f2ins) - read(suf)   (F2 = HELD-OUT mechanism — the generalization test)
