"""RUNTIME-FEEDBACK suite — does EXECUTION feedback help a strong agent, the way the
language server's static INFORMATION does not?

THE QUESTION. Our headline result (REPORT.md §3) is that a language server's information
is redundant for a self-retrieving agent: the facts it serves (a symbol's type, its
definition, its references) are already in the source, so a capable reader derives them
and pass@1 does not move. The natural boundary question is what the agent CANNOT derive by
reading. Source code is a program; its behaviour on an input is that program executed. To
get behaviour from source the model must mentally EXECUTE it, and that simulation can be
wrong. Runtime feedback (a failing test) delivers exactly what the model's own simulation
got wrong, which a static read cannot.

So this suite is the mirror of gapd2. There the wrong fix PASSED the visible test (the
checker was the only possible detector); here the wrong fix FAILS the visible test, so
RUNNING is the detector. The agent is run under three arms (api_agent.py flags):

  R0  --no-test            no run_tests tool: the agent must reason about behaviour from
                           the source and the shown spec, then call done(). (The spec is
                           still shown as static text, so R0 knows WHAT is checked, it just
                           cannot RUN it: this isolates "can it simulate" from "does it
                           know the target".)
  R1  (default)            run_tests available; the agent elects to run the visible test.
  R2  --auto-feedback      the env volunteers the visible-test result after every edit
                           (execution handed over for free, no election needed).

Scoring is HELD-OUT in every arm (`resolved` = score() on held_out, `visible_pass` = the
test the agent could run). Held-out scoring does real work in all three arms: in R0 it
catches a mis-simulated fix; in R1/R2 it catches a fix that overfits the one shown assert
but is wrong on other inputs. Run all three with --no-hint (the visible test is informative
here, NOT a partial spec to be suspicious of, so the gapd2 "partial spec" note is omitted
and auto-stop-on-visible-pass is the natural behaviour for R1/R2).

EVERY wrong fix is WELL-TYPED (the verifier checks pyrefly is clean on it, W4). The bug is
pure runtime logic, so a type checker is NOT a detector and check_types would be useless on
this whole suite: the discriminator is execution, period. This is the deliberate contrast
with gapd2, where the checker COULD see the latent bug.

SIMULATION-DIFFICULTY STRATIFICATION (the `sim`/`group` field, "hard" | "easy"). The
secondary hypothesis is that the value of execution rises with how hard the code is to
mentally execute. HARD tasks are multi-step / stateful / boundary / off-by-one logic where
a careful read is genuinely unreliable (sliding windows, the forgotten final flush, tier
boundaries, run counting). EASY tasks are one-line specs where the fix is obvious from
reading (a missing abs(), a one-sided clamp, a missing empty guard); a strong model should
solve those in R0 too, so execution should add little there.

THE RUNTIME-SUITE INVARIANT (enforced by __main__):
  W1  stub:  held-out score() FAILS (NotImplementedError).
  W2  gold:  visible run_tests() PASSES and held-out score() PASSES.
  W3  wrong: visible run_tests() FAILS and held-out score() FAILS, and wrong != gold.
             (KEY, the opposite of gapd2 V3: here RUNNING the visible test exposes the bug.)
  W4  wrong is WELL-TYPED: target-scoped pyrefly is CLEAN, so execution is the only
             in-budget detector.

Schema (single-file tasks; everything needed is in target.py + the shown test, so R0 is not
penalised for a file it cannot read):
  name, group("hard"|"easy"), target("target.py"), files{"target.py": stub},
  test(VISIBLE), held_out(HELD-OUT), gold_target, wrong_guess, sim, note.

Run the verifier with python3; one pyrefly process at a time.
api_agent.py loads it via --suite runtime / TASKS_RUNTIME.
