"""NODEL suite — does the agent JUDGE retrieval-coverage by USING the retrieved BODY CONTENT, with the
DELEGATION escape hatch removed? Sibling of synth_tasks_effic_decouple.py (the DECOUPLE suite), built to
fix that suite's fatal confound and re-run the SAME coverage A/B experiment cleanly.

WHY A NEW SUITE (the confound we are killing). The DECOUPLE suite's gold fix was DELEGATION —
`return combine(a, b)`: the target just forwards to the imported symbol. That works whether `<defn sym>`
returned the FULL body (A) or the opaque stub (B), because the agent never needed the body's CONTENT,
only a callable to forward to. Both variants export a working callable, so A and B were behaviourally
EQUIVALENT for a delegating agent and the coverage test was destroyed. The fix here: the correct edit
must TRANSCRIBE the CONTENT of the retrieved definition INLINE at the bug site, and there is NO in-scope
callable (and no usable data structure) to forward to.

THE DESIGN — "denormalised inlined table, completeness/transcription". Each pair_id has TWO variants
whose prompt / bug / function-to-fix / test are the SAME TEMPLATE (only the topic noun differs ACROSS
pairs, never WITHIN a pair between A and B). Nothing in the task text tells the agent which case it is.

  target.py holds its OWN, LOCAL, INLINED copy of a lookup written as explicit `if key == ...: return
  <const>` branches (a denormalised hot-path copy — REALISTIC: the docstring says the table is inlined
  here for the hot path and biglib is deliberately NOT imported at call time to avoid a heavy/circular
  import). The local copy is BUGGY: it is MISSING cases and/or has WRONG arbitrary constants. The
  authoritative reference lives in biglib.py as the DATA symbol `SPEC` (a flat denormalised array, see
  below). To fix, the agent must inspect `SPEC`, read off the per-key arbitrary constants, and write the
  missing/correct branches INLINE.

  VARIANT A (defn_sufficient=True):  `SPEC` is a FULL top-level Assign with all literal entries.
    goto_definition("SPEC") (mock_env.py:198-200 Assign branch) returns the WHOLE multi-line literal, so
    the per-key constants are right there in the span and the fix is derivable from the defn alone.

  VARIANT B (defn_sufficient=False, requires_read=True): `SPEC` is a top-level ONE-LINE alias
    `SPEC = _TBL[pos]` into a SHUFFLED table of decoy arrays. goto_definition("SPEC") returns ONLY that
    one opaque line — it names no `_SPEC_*` directly (the subscript position != the impl's name suffix),
    so a single follow-up `<defn>` cannot resolve it. The real array is one of >=6 similarly-named decoy
    arrays (each a DIFFERENT arbitrary table); it is identifiable only by READING biglib.py. The agent
    must: <defn SPEC> -> see it is an opaque alias -> <read biglib.py> -> find the real array -> transcribe.

  A coverage-judging agent solves BOTH; a surface-keyed / delegating agent fails B (it has no callable to
  forward to and the stub array reveals nothing, so it emits the idiomatic-but-WRONG table and fails).

WHY THE DELEGATION ESCAPE IS GONE (the whole point — enumerated in the module docstring; the verifier
also asserts R-nodel):
  - There is NO callable in biglib to forward to. biglib exposes only DATA (`SPEC` and the decoy arrays)
    plus unrelated filler classes. `from biglib import SPEC; return SPEC[k]` does NOT type-check or work:
    SPEC is a FLAT array `(k0, v0, k1, v1, ...)` (a denormalised hot-path layout), not a mapping — there
    is no key-indexed lookup to forward to. Reconstructing the answer from it requires writing the same
    branch logic anyway, i.e. transcribing the content.
  - The target deliberately does NOT import SPEC (REALISTIC hot-path / no-startup-import reason in the
    docstring), and the gold fix adds NO import — it INLINES the constants. The verifier's R-nodel gate
    asserts the gold diff introduces NO call to any biglib symbol and adds no `from biglib import` of a
    data/callable used as a forward target; the new content is literal constants transcribed from SPEC.

GUESS-RESISTANCE (kills confound #1): every per-key value is an ARBITRARY constant (e.g. an affine
i*9-4 of an opaque code, a 3-digit checksum, a reversed-with-offset string) NOT inferable from the key
name, the function name, or the docstring. The idiomatic guess (identity, +1, the key itself) is
type-valid but TEST-REJECTED. The behavioural test pins the EXACT arbitrary values via a checksum
(sha256 of the joined repr()s over a fixed INPUT set), so a FAILING run reveals nothing (opaque hash) and
'guess then fit to the revealed expected output' cannot converge — the only way to pass is to READ the
constants. The digest is computed IN-PROCESS from the gold body at construction time (never hand-written).

SCHEMA (per task dict) — a SUPERSET of synth_tasks_effic.py's schema plus the decouple/nodel keys:
  name (effic_nd_<topic>_a | _b), pair_id, group("rich"), target("target.py"),
  symbol ("SPEC" — the DATA symbol the agent inspects; SAME string in A and B of a pair),
  defn_sufficient (bool), requires_read (bool; True only on B),
  files{target.py(buggy inlined table), biglib.py(SPEC + decoys)}, test(checksum, passes on gold),
  gold_target(corrected inlined table), inputs, real_body (the gold target body used for the digest),
  lsp_oracle={"defn": {SPEC: <what goto_definition returns>}, ...},
  wrong_guess (idiomatic-wrong gold splice — proves non-guessability), wrong_kind("value"),
  wrong_note, real_api (the substring the FIX must transcribe — a distinctive arbitrary constant/branch;
  the verifier asserts A's defn CONTAINS it and B's defn-stub does NOT but the full read DOES),
  local (the public function name in target.py the test imports),
  delegate_syms (the set of biglib symbols a delegating fix COULD try to forward to — verifier asserts
  the gold introduces NO call to any of them: R-nodel).

VERIFIER (__main__): per task assert (mirrors effic R1-R5 + decouple R6/R7 + the new R-nodel / R-arb):
  R1 buggy target FAILs the test; R2 gold PASSes AND is pyrefly-clean (nerr==0);
  R3 biglib big (defn_lines*5 < biglib_n for A; >=200 lines for B);
  R4 NON-GUESSABLE (idiomatic wrong_guess spliced into gold => test FAIL) AND hash-unique (none of the
     decoy arrays reproduces the gold checksum);
  R5 no leak — no expected-output literal and no API-surface token in the test (only INPUTS + the hash);
  R6 DECOUPLING — goto_definition(SPEC): A's span CONTAINS real_api; B's span is a one-line opaque alias
     that does NOT contain real_api (and names no `_SPEC_`), while the full read DOES contain it;
  R7 PAIR-SURFACE-IDENTITY — A and B target.py + test + symbol are byte-identical (no prompt cue);
  R-nodel (NEW) — the gold diff vs the buggy target adds NO call to any delegate_sym and adds no
     `from biglib import` line: the fix is pure inline transcription, with no content-free forward;
  R-arb (NEW) — the pinned test values are arbitrary: for each input the gold output differs from the
     idiomatic/derivable-from-name guess output, so the values cannot be reconstructed from names.
