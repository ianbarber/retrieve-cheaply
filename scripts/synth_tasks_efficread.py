"""READ-REQUIRED suite — the BOUNDARY / validity gate for the effic training result.

We trained a 7B agent to PREFER a cheap `<defn sym/>` retrieval over an expensive `<read path/>`
on tasks where ONE symbol's definition is SUFFICIENT to solve (synth_tasks_effic.py; 2%->100%
defn-use). The risk this suite guards against: the model may have COLLAPSED to always emitting
`<defn>` even when it shouldn't. So we need tasks where `<defn>` is GENUINELY INSUFFICIENT and the
only-workable retrieval is `<read>` — to confirm the model learned "defn WHEN SUFFICIENT, READ WHEN
NEEDED" rather than blindly always-defn.

THE KEY DESIGN — what makes `<read>` genuinely required: `<defn sym="NAME"/>` requires the model to
KNOW the symbol NAME. We deny it that name two ways:

  FLAVOR A (name-hidden, tasks 1-4): the target's docstring describes the GOAL in PROSE
    ("use the helper in biglib that validates/normalizes/encodes ... and return ...") WITHOUT naming
    the function/class. The real symbol lives in biglib.py under a NON-OBVIOUS name (e.g. a private
    `_canon_token`) buried among many `_filler` classes, ALONGSIDE several DISTRACTOR helpers with the
    obvious/idiomatic names (`slugify`, `normalize`, `to_slug`) that do NOT solve the task. The model
    cannot guess which symbol to call, nor its name, so `<defn sym="slugify"/>` returns a distractor
    or `(no definition found)`. The ONLY workable move is `<read biglib.py>` to discover the right
    symbol and its API.

  FLAVOR B (many-symbol, tasks 5-6): the target legitimately needs >=4 DISTINCT symbols whose names
    ARE known (named in the docstring). Issuing >=4 separate `<defn>` calls is strictly more expensive
    and more error-prone than a single `<read biglib.py>`, so reading once is the natural / only
    economical move. Marked many_symbol=True; requires_read=True.

SCHEMA (per task dict), mirroring synth_tasks_effic.py:
  name, group("readreq"), target("target.py"), symbol(the real symbol the gold must use; for FLAVOR B
  the PRIMARY one — `symbols` lists all),
  files{target.py(prose stub), biglib.py(big_src, real symbol buried + distractors)},
  test(spec, passes on gold), gold_target(corrected, uses the real discoverable-only-by-reading symbol),
  defn_sufficient=False, requires_read=True, many_symbol(bool),
  lsp_oracle = minimal {"defn": {sym: src}} (the point here is READ, not defn).

VERIFIER (__main__, mirrors synth_tasks_effic.py): per task print a row and assert
  R1 stub FAILs the test;
  R2 gold PASSes AND is pyrefly-clean;
  R3 READ-REQUIRED — flavor-aware. FLAVOR A (name-hidden): the real symbol NAME does NOT appear in
     target.py (so it cannot be defn'd straight from the stub) AND DOES appear in biglib.py (so it is
     discoverable only by reading). FLAVOR B (many-symbol): >=4 distinct symbols, all present in
     biglib.py — names are known but >=4 defn calls cost more than one read, so reading is required on
     economic grounds (the names are SUPPOSED to be in the stub here);
  R4 biglib big (>=200 lines);
  R5 no-leak — the real symbol name / its member-access does not appear in the test.
Prints "ALL OK" only when every task passes R1-R5. Run:
